## Prompt

Module 2 – The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Type: Docusaurus curriculum
Focus: Humanoid simulation and visualization

Audience: Students with ROS 2 knowledge, beginners in Gazebo/Unity
Goal: Simulate robots, sensors, and environments

Chapters:

Physics (Gazebo): Gravity, collisions, robot control

Sensors: LiDAR, cameras, IMUs, ROS 2 integration

Rendering (Unity): Visualize robots, import models, lighting

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive specification for the Digital Twin curriculum module focusing on Gazebo & Unity integration. The specification includes:

- User Story 1: Physics Simulation in Gazebo (Priority: P1) - Core physics simulation with gravity, collisions, and robot control
- User Story 2: Sensor Integration and ROS 2 Communication (Priority: P2) - Integration of LiDAR, cameras, IMUs with ROS 2
- User Story 3: Unity Visualization and Rendering (Priority: P3) - Visualization of robots and environments in Unity

Functional requirements cover Gazebo simulation, sensor integration, Unity visualization, and ROS 2 communication. Success criteria include measurable outcomes for student learning within specific timeframes.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete feature specification for digital twin curriculum module
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests created yet
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements checklist
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for clarification or planning phase
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification addresses all aspects of the curriculum module with clear user stories and measurable outcomes

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to planning phase
