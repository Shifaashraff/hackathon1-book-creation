## Prompt

Module 3 – The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

Target audience: Students with ROS 2 knowledge and experience in simulation (Modules 1 & 2)

Focus: AI perception, navigation, and intelligent control of humanoid robots

Chapters:

Isaac Sim: Photorealistic humanoid simulation and synthetic data generation

Isaac ROS: VSLAM, perception pipelines, and AI-powered navigation

Nav2: Path planning and obstacle avoidance for bipedal humanoid movement

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive specification for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac). The specification includes:

- User Story 1 (P1): Isaac Sim - Photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- User Story 2 (P2): Isaac ROS - VSLAM and perception pipelines
- User Story 3 (P3): Nav2 - Path planning for bipedal humanoid movement

Functional requirements cover Isaac Sim environment, synthetic data generation, Isaac ROS integration, VSLAM algorithms, object detection, Nav2 integration, and bipedal locomotion constraints. Success criteria include measurable outcomes for student learning within specific timeframes.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete feature specification for Isaac AI Robot Brain curriculum
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests created yet
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements checklist
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for clarification or planning phase
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification addresses all aspects of the curriculum module with clear user stories and measurable outcomes

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to planning phase
