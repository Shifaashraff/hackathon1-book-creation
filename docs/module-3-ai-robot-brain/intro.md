# Isaac AI Robot Brain Curriculum

Welcome to the Isaac AI Robot Brain curriculum, where you'll learn to develop AI-powered humanoid robotics using the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem. This module builds upon your existing knowledge of ROS 2 and simulation from Modules 1 & 2.

## Overview

This curriculum is designed to teach you how to:
- Create photorealistic humanoid simulations in Isaac Sim
- Implement VSLAM and perception pipelines using Isaac ROS
- Configure Nav2 for bipedal humanoid navigation
- Generate synthetic datasets for AI training
- Integrate all systems for complete AI robot brain functionality

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Experience with ROS 2 (Humble Hawksbill)
- Knowledge of simulation concepts
- Understanding of basic robotics principles
- Familiarity with Python and C++ programming

## Learning Path

The curriculum is organized into three progressive chapters:

1. **Isaac Sim** - Learn to create photorealistic humanoid simulations and generate synthetic data
2. **Isaac ROS** - Implement perception pipelines and VSLAM for environmental understanding
3. **Nav2** - Configure navigation systems specifically for bipedal humanoid movement

Each chapter includes hands-on exercises and practical examples to reinforce your learning.
