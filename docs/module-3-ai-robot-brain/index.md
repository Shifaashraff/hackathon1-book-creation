# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

Welcome to Module 3 of the AI-Robotics curriculum, focusing on the AI-Robot Brain using NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem. This module covers advanced topics in AI perception, navigation, and intelligent control of humanoid robots using Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2.

## Overview

This module teaches students how to create an AI-powered brain for humanoid robots using NVIDIA's Isaac ecosystem. Students will learn to implement photorealistic simulation, perception pipelines, and navigation systems that enable robots to understand their environment and navigate intelligently.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Set up Isaac Sim for photorealistic humanoid simulation and synthetic data generation
- Implement visual SLAM (VSLAM) and perception pipelines using Isaac ROS
- Configure path planning algorithms specifically tailored for bipedal humanoid movement using Nav2
- Integrate perception data with navigation for intelligent robot behavior
- Develop AI-driven navigation systems that can operate in complex environments

## Target Audience

This module is designed for students with:
- Prior knowledge of ROS 2 concepts and fundamentals
- Experience with simulation environments
- Understanding of basic robot control and navigation
- Familiarity with Python and basic machine learning concepts

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three main user stories:

### User Story 1: Isaac Sim - Photorealistic Simulation and Synthetic Data Generation
Learn to create photorealistic humanoid simulations in Isaac Sim and generate synthetic training data for perception and navigation algorithms.

### User Story 2: Isaac ROS - VSLAM and Perception Pipelines
Implement visual SLAM and perception pipelines using Isaac ROS to enable the robot to understand its environment.

### User Story 3: Nav2 - Path Planning for Bipedal Humanoid Movement
Implement path planning algorithms specifically tailored for bipedal humanoid movement using Nav2.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, students should have:
- Completed Modules 1 and 2 of the curriculum
- Basic understanding of ROS 2 and robot operating systems
- Experience with simulation environments like Gazebo or Isaac Sim
- Programming experience in Python and/or C++
- Understanding of basic computer vision and perception concepts

## Technology Stack

This module utilizes the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem:
- **Isaac Sim**: For photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
