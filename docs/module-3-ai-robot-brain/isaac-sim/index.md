# Isaac Sim: Photorealistic Simulation and Synthetic Data Generation

Welcome to the Isaac Sim section of the AI-Robot Brain curriculum. This module focuses on creating photorealistic humanoid simulations and generating synthetic data for AI perception and navigation systems.

## Overview

Isaac Sim is NVIDIA's robotics simulation environment that provides:
- Photorealistic rendering capabilities for training AI models
- Physically accurate simulation of humanoid robots
- Synthetic data generation tools for perception algorithms
- Integration with Isaac ROS for perception pipelines

## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Set up Isaac Sim with proper hardware and software requirements
- Configure photorealistic rendering for humanoid robot simulation
- Generate synthetic sensor data (RGB, depth, semantic segmentation)
- Create realistic physics simulations for humanoid movement
- Integrate Isaac Sim with Isaac ROS for perception pipeline testing

## Getting Started

Begin with the [Setup Guide](./setup.md) to install and configure Isaac Sim on your system. This will ensure you have all the necessary prerequisites and environment variables configured properly.

## Chapter Structure

This section is organized into the following chapters:

1. [Setup Guide](./setup.md) - Installation and configuration of Isaac Sim
2. [Photorealistic Simulation](./photorealistic-simulation.md) - Creating realistic environments and rendering
3. [Synthetic Data Generation](./synthetic-data-generation.md) - Generating training data for AI models
4. [Exercises](./exercises.md) - Hands-on activities to reinforce learning

## Prerequisites

Before starting this section, ensure you have:
- A compatible NVIDIA RTX GPU with proper drivers
- CUDA 12.x installed
