# Isaac AI Robot Brain Curriculum

Welcome to the comprehensive curriculum for developing AI-powered humanoid robots using the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem. This course will take you from basic simulation concepts to advanced Vision-Language-Action systems.

## Course Overview

This curriculum is structured into four progressive modules:

- **Module 1**: Introduction to Isaac Sim and basic robot simulation
- **Module 2**: ROS 2 fundamentals and robot communication
- **Module 3**: AI perception and navigation systems
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action systems for voice control

Each module builds upon the previous one, providing hands-on experience with industry-standard tools and techniques.

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 1 to establish a solid foundation, or jump to a specific module if you already have the prerequisite knowledge. Each module includes practical exercises, assessments, and capstone projects to reinforce your learning.

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (recommended)

Let's begin your journey into AI-powered robotics!
